# ðŸ§© The Composable Architecture (TCA) Tutorials

This project contains a series of examples implemented while following the [Composable Architecture Tutorials by Point-Free](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture).  
Through hands-on practice, I explored the core concepts of TCA and learned how to effectively separate complex state management from side effects.

The tutorials cover how to build scalable and testable applications using TCA by modeling state, handling navigation, and performing asynchronous effects in a structured and predictable way.
